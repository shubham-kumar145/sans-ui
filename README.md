Geometric sans-serif typeface to populate the interfaces of Cal.com

---

Introducing two new families, **Cal Sans UI** and **Cal Sans Text** designed by Mark Davis for [Cal.com](https://refer.cal.com/davis). Every detail is reconsidered for readers, product designers, and developers at the same time. **Cal Sans UI** is also a variable font, built with stylistic variations to both approach through a `MODE` (UI or Text Mode) axis, and a traditional weight axis with a MVP range of Light ↔ Bold. Since advising Peer Richelsen in 2021 on the typography needed at the start of his Cal.com journey, the open-source font landscape for UI had not changed. This is why it felt like an excellent opportunity to add more to the conversation and a new tool to choose from. Cal Sans UI and Cal Sans Text work perfectly at all point-sizes, but it has been optimized at the pixel-level for between 14–15px UI interfaces with high-DPI screen target. It can also be deployed skilfully and successfully at larger or smaller sizes, but if going much bigger with shorter texts or single words, consider Cal Sans instead.

### Why are there two families?
There were many use cases and applications of a small-size version of the un-changed headline font, and the opportunity was too enticing to have a future [fully responsive single font with an optical size axis](https://www.reddit.com/r/typography/comments/1lhs7j5/cal_sans_but_with_a_size_axisopen_source_and/). So! We simply kept both and for this release all can use whatever works best. Also we anticipate future integration [with the Google Fonts API that does not allow stylistic sets](https://x.com/MarkFonts/status/1968066680762012039) and it is Mark’s personally held belief that designers better understood how to use alternative letters when they had to rub them down manually themselves like [Letraset](https://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/rub-down-revolution) sheets or catalogues, not stare down optionless webfont testing pages or even premium fonts that happen to have alternatives by surprise.

![letraset](documentation/images/2_aggb_letraset.png)
To get to where we are, we have made changes to the previous design. The first change was the lower case dimensions—lengthening extenders like ascenders and descenders, and lowered all the x-heights. This makes the sentence shape more discernible around the few capitals. While shortening and also lengthening lowercase characters, we have slightly flattened all circular characters by approximately 7–8% of their original width in circularity, for a little more economy compared to Grotesks and the display style. We have added minuscule gaps to stroke joins, all terminals have been rotated away from their counters forms by 8%. 40–42 units were added to all sidebearings, or the built-in spacing in the left and right side of glyphs, compared to [**Cal Sans** (2021)](https://github.com/calcom/sans). So, yes, it is still tighter than in-market Open Source UI fonts, so we apologize that designers will not be able to farm engagement pictures with Cal Sans UI using tiny annotations of letterspacing adjustments.

![charset](documentation/images/2_CSUI_charset.png)
Futura is a legendary typeface; however, its proportions and metrics defy web and app constrictions. Changing only x-heights makes text run too long. We underwent a 5-month exploration to make a light master *and* make every glyph slightly narrower, while retaining the friendly, geometric appearance which has many visual benefits. The text version retains the Futura-style **a** and **G**, plus the friendly Cal.com-style punctuation. Based on your needs, you can change details via stylistic sets, and choosing a family is now a lot easier. Both sets come in 5 styles, and contain Latin diacritics (including Vietnamese and Marshalleese), many dingbats, common symbols, and a single one-color emoji.

![Have It](documentation/images/2_haveit.png)
Essential for disambiguation-heavy short texts and numeral/letter mixed environments, our friend, the double story a, makes its debut. It took Mark many months and lost him much sleep, but he’s quite pleased with it ✨

![Proportions](documentation/images/3_proportions.png)
We did not depart too far from the original proportions of [**Cal Sans**](https://github.com/calcom/sans). The modest x-heights didn’t cost line-length (as compared to SF Pro/Inter).

![examples](documentation/images/2_CSUI_examples.png)
The true test of the much-hyped accessibility, readability, or legibility is if it just *works* in the practically expected *in*opportune conditions: moving your eyes quickly, poor light, screen too far, or the long list of inevitable degenerative optical conditions (including my dad, a web accessibility engineer who has also lost 60% of sight acuity in one eye). You just blur it.

![Gify](documentation/images/4_geometry.gif)
Cal Sans UI and Cal Sans Text has nearly a thousand glyphs and components, nearly 300 more glyphs than the previous release. And 3,000 kerns.

## Step 2: Build the fonts


### Navigate to /sources
Assuming you are already in the root directory

```
cd sources
```

<!-- **Note:** The alternative Text glyphs are produced using stylistic sets in the source file. If you want to include new glyphs for Text Mode, please ensure to generate them at position `[0,5<MODE<1]` in the Text to UI Mode axis. -->


### Build designspace file in /master_ufo

**Notes:** 

- Run this command every time you make changes to the source file.
- Once you update the designspace, paste the contents of the `RulesFeatureVariations.txt` file into your .designspace file.

### Build OTvar and TTF fonts

```
gftools builder config.yaml
```

<!-- ### Build static TTF fonts

```
sh build-statics.sh
